# Roadmap: Universal E-Commerce Template

## Overview

This roadmap delivers a production-ready, universal e-commerce template through 21 phases -- one per feature domain. The build order flows from foundational schema design through authentication, product catalog, discovery (search/filters), purchase flow (cart/checkout/payments), fulfillment (orders/shipping/inventory), engagement (promotions/reviews/notifications), and finally cross-cutting concerns (analytics/SEO/multi-store/admin). Each phase includes implementation across server, client, and admin apps where applicable. Research precedes every phase.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work
- Decimal phases (2.1, 2.2): Urgent insertions (marked with INSERTED)

## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Database Schema Design
**Goal**: All database schemas are production-ready with proper models, relations, indexes, and seed data so every subsequent phase can build on a solid data foundation
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)

**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running `prisma db push` succeeds and creates all PostgreSQL tables (User, Product, ProductVariant, Category, Brand, Tag, Collection, Address, Wishlist, Review, Coupon, Promotion, ShippingZone, ShippingMethod, Warehouse, InventoryItem, CategoryAttribute) with correct relations and indexes
  2. Mongoose models (Order, Cart) can be instantiated with full lifecycle fields, and Cart documents auto-expire via TTL
  3. Running `prisma db seed` populates the database with realistic sample data covering all product types, categories at multiple depths, and related entities
  4. JSONB columns on Product have GIN indexes and Category model uses materialized path string for tree hierarchy
  5. All schemas have proper cascading deletes, unique constraints, and validation (no orphaned records possible)

**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 18
**Requirements**: ADMN-01, ADMN-02, ADMN-03, ADMN-04, ADMN-05, ADMN-06, ADMN-07, ADMN-08
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Admin dashboard shows KPI cards (revenue, orders, customers, conversion rate) with real data from all modules
  2. Sidebar navigation is organized by module with collapsible sections, and the layout is responsive on tablet and desktop
  3. Role-based access control enforces permissions: SUPER_ADMIN sees everything, ADMIN has configurable module-level permissions
  4. Reusable data table component supports sorting, filtering, pagination, and bulk actions across all entity types, and reusable form component supports validation, image upload, and rich text editing
  5. Activity log shows who changed what and when, and settings page allows store configuration (name, logo, contact, tax rates, policies)
**Plans**: TBD (estimated 6-8)

Plans:

## Progress

**Execution Order:**
Phases execute in numeric order: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 6 > 7 > 8 > 9 > 10 > 11 > 12 > 13 > 14 > 15 > 16 > 17 > 18 > 19 > 20 > 21

Note: Some phases share dependencies and could theoretically run in parallel (e.g., Phase 5 and Phase 7 both depend on Phase 3). The linear order above is the recommended solo-developer sequence.
