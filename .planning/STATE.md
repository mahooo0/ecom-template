- [Phase 13]: Use two-tier zone matching algorithm: state-specific zones > country-wide zones
- [Phase 13]: Check free shipping threshold before calculating rate type cost
- [Phase 13]: Filter out weight-exceeded methods instead of showing errors to users
- [Phase 13]: Make POST /api/shipping/calculate public endpoint for checkout consumption

- [Phase 05-03]: React InstantSearch for UI - Official library provides pre-built components with TypeScript support
- [Phase 05-03]: Client components for search interactivity - SearchBar and SearchResultsPage require useState and useSearchParams
- [Phase 05-03]: Suspense boundary for search page - useSearchParams() requires Suspense to prevent SSR errors
- [Phase 06-02]: Install nuqs at workspace root so vitest can resolve it (not just apps/client)
- [Phase 06-02]: Build custom Tailwind CSS filter UI instead of shadcn/ui - project uses Tailwind v4 without shadcn config
- [Phase 06-02]: Use vi.hoisted() for mock variables referenced in vi.mock() factory functions (ESM hoisting requirement)
- [Phase 06-01]: Vitest 4.x requires vi.hoisted() for mock functions AND absolute paths in vi.mock() - module aliases not resolved in vi.mock()
- [Phase 06-01]: JSONB attribute filtering uses OR within same key group, AND across different key groups - maps to Prisma AND array with OR sub-arrays
- [Phase 06-01]: Attribute facets computed in application code (not SQL) to avoid complex JSONB aggregation queries
- [Phase Phase 06-03]: Build custom slide-in drawer instead of shadcn/ui Sheet (project uses Tailwind v4 without shadcn config)
- [Phase Phase 06-03]: FilterDrawer snapshots filter state on open into pendingFilters to defer URL commits until Apply is clicked
- [Phase Phase 06-03]: FilterButton uses lg:hidden class for mobile-only visibility, FilterSidebar uses hidden lg:block for desktop-only
- [Phase 06]: NuqsAdapter added at root layout level so all client filter components can use useQueryStates
- [Phase 06]: Promise.all for parallel filter + facets fetch to reduce category page load latency
- [Phase 06-04]: noindex robots meta on filtered category views with canonical to base URL for SEO
- [Phase 06]: Three mutually exclusive availability states: in_stock (has stock), out_of_stock (no stock AND allowPreorder=false), pre_order (no stock AND allowPreorder=true)
- [Phase 06]: Dynamic priceRange derived from prisma.product.aggregate _min/_max price instead of hardcoded null
- [Phase 07-01]: Place /:id/related and /:id/fbt routes before /:id to prevent Express route shadowing
- [Phase 07-01]: FBT minimum co-occurrence threshold of 2 orders to filter noise from single co-purchases
- [Phase 07-01]: getRelated uses OR logic across categoryId and tag IDs to maximize product coverage
- [Phase 07-01]: FBT wrapped in try/catch returning [] for graceful degradation when MongoDB has no order history
- [Phase 07]: Use CSS backgroundImage overlay for hover zoom - no external zoom library needed
- [Phase 07]: scroll event + Math.round(scrollLeft/offsetWidth) for mobile dot tracking - simpler than IntersectionObserver
- [Phase 07-05]: Server-safe components for ProductSpecsTable and ReviewsPlaceholder - pure display with no client interactivity
- [Phase 07-05]: CSS snap scrolling for RelatedProductsCarousel avoids carousel library dependency
- [Phase 07-05]: FrequentlyBoughtTogether uses Set<string> for checked IDs for O(1) toggle and clean filtering
- [Phase 07-03]: Variant matrix built with sorted option key strings in useMemo - deterministic and order-independent
- [Phase 07-03]: AddToCartButton uses imageUrl and sku fields matching CartItem interface from @repo/types (not image as plan specified)
- [Phase 07-04]: Emoji icons for digital file types instead of external icon library - keeps bundle small and avoids dependency
- [Phase 07-04]: WeightedQuantitySelector clamps weight to [minWeight, maxWeight] to prevent out-of-range price calculations
- [Phase 07-04]: BundleItemsList returns null for empty items - prevents rendering broken empty sections
- [Phase 07-06]: Server Component + Client Island pattern: server fetches all data, passes as props to client island for interactivity
- [Phase 07-06]: Promise.allSettled for related/FBT fetches in product page — graceful degradation with empty arrays on failure
- [Phase 07-06]: category: { include: { attributes: true } } in getBySlug for ProductSpecsTable display names
- [Phase 14]: Add $queryRaw mock alongside warehouse/inventoryItem/stockMovement for raw SQL low-stock queries
- [Phase 14]: Follow same it.todo() stub pattern as shipping tests without vi.mock in stub-only files
- [Phase 14]: Use available(item) helper function everywhere to prevent exposing raw quantity without reserved
- [Phase 14]: RESERVATION and RESERVATION_RELEASE excluded from adjustStockSchema - system-only reasons used by reservation system
- [Phase 14]: inventory.lowStock and inventory.stockUpdated events added to EventMap for Phase 17 notification subscription
- [Phase 14]: Use prisma.$transaction interactive callback for reserveStock to prevent TOCTOU race conditions
- [Phase 14]: releaseReservation idempotency via Set of inventoryItemId from existing RESERVATION_RELEASE movements
- [Phase 14]: startReservationCleanup() not wired into index.ts yet - deferred to Plan 03 when routes are mounted
- [Phase 14]: getWarehouseById implemented inline in controller using prisma.warehouse.findUnique — not in InventoryService
- [Phase 14]: reserveStock controller auto-selects best warehouse via findBestWarehouse when warehouseId omitted
- [Phase 14]: Reservation endpoints (reserve/commit/release) are public — no requireAdmin — for checkout flow consumption
- [Phase 14]: Promise.all for dashboard+alerts fetch in inventory dashboard — parallel requests reduce load latency
- [Phase 14]: WarehouseForm optional warehouse prop — undefined=create mode, defined=edit mode, consistent with existing admin form patterns
- [Phase 08]: priceAtAdd stored as Int @default(0) in WishlistItem — captures price-at-add-time for price-drop badge, consistent with cents convention
- [Phase 08]: WishlistPriceDropEvent and WishlistRestockEvent added to types now so Phase 17 Notifications can consume them without schema changes
- [Phase 08]: getOrCreateWishlist lazy-creates wishlist on first use — no migration needed for existing users
- [Phase 08]: upsert with update:{} for addItem and syncItems — skip-if-exists deduplication without error
- [Phase 08-02]: Separate client islands: CompareCheckbox and WishlistButton prevent full ProductCard grid re-renders
- [Phase 08-02]: WishlistButton optimistic rollback: reverts Zustand state on API failure for authenticated users
